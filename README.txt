This script is designed to find relevant new members on OKCupid as quick as possible.  That way the user can be among the first to message them and have a better chance of getting an actual response.

The script will access the search page on OKCupid and pull profile information for members on the first page.  For the next N days (specified by the user) changes to the member's profile will be tracked as they fill out and save changes to their profile.  If a keyword comes up (specified by the user) the script will email them with a picture, keyword hits, and link to their profile.
